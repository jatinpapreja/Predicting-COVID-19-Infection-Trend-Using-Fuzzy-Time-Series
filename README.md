## FUZZY TIME SERIES
<p align= "justify">The use of fuzzy sets for modeling and predicting time series arises almost intuitively, first based on the ability of fuzzy models to approximate functions, but also on the readability of rules using linguistic variables that make them more accessible to experts and non-experts analysis.</p>

**The approach and implementation of the project can be broadly classified under following sections:**
* Dataset Analysis
* Fuzzy Time Series System 
* Partitioning Types

<p align= "justify">The influence of parameters such as number of partitions and partitioning schemes on the performance of FTS models has been studied. Further, comparisons with Moving Averages Time Series model and Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) are performed to highlight the real-life usefulness of the FTS models. Results shows that Fuzzy Time Series forecasting model performs better than ARIMA time series forecasting model. The error value of the fuzzy time series is less than the ARIMA time series error value. So it is concluded that the fuzzy time series can gives us better results than other time series models.</p>
